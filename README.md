## Frequency Counter Pattern

This pattern uses objects or set to collect values/frequencies of values

this can often avoid nested looping or O(n^2)


## Algorithms

### How do you improve?
1. Devise a plan for solving problems
2. Master common problem-solving patterns


### 1 - Problem Solving

1. Understand the problem
1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
2. What are the inputs that go into the problems?
3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
4. Can the output be determined by the inputs.?
5. How should I label important pieces of data that are part of the problem?

### 2 - Concrete Examples:
   Coming up with examples can help you understand the problem

### 3 - Break it down:
   Explicitly write out the step you need to take.

### 4 - Solve/Simplify:
1. Find the core difficulty in what youâ€™r trying to do.
2. Temporarily ignore that difficulty
3. Write a simplified solution
4. Incorporate that solution.

### 5 - Look back and refactor:
1. Can you check the result?
2. Can you derive the result differently?
3. Can you understand it at a glance?
4. Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
5. Can you improve the performance of your solution?
6. Can you think of other ways to refactor?
7. How have other people solved this problem?
